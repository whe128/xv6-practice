// This example is identical to testclone1, except that we are using wait()
// instead of join() to waith for the threads to finish.
// A correct implementation of wait() should ignore threads; it should only
// wait for child processes that do not share the address space. So in a correct
// implementation, the parent process will terminate, and the child threads will
// be killed and then reaped by the init process.
// If you implemented wait() and exit() incorrectly, this could lead to a crash,
// e.g., because you accidentally destroy the virtual memory mapping that is shared
// between threads.
